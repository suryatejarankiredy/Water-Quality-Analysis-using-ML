# Edunet_Water-Quality-Analysis

Project Description: _WaterSafe_ - *Revolutionizing Water Quality Analysis*

The "Water Quality Analysis" project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the quality of water based on various physical, chemical, and biological parameters. The model will use historical data on water quality collected from different sources to identify patterns and relationships between different variables that affect water quality.

The project will involve collecting data from various sources, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions. The data will be pre-processed and cleaned to remove any outliers or missing values. Feature engineering techniques will be applied to extract relevant features from the raw data.

The machine learning model will be trained using a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering. The performance of each algorithm will be evaluated using different metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing algorithm will be selected for the final model.

The final model will be used to predict the quality of water in real-time. The model will be deployed on a web-based platform, allowing users to input various parameters related to water quality and receive a prediction of water quality. The platform will also provide users with visualizations and insights into the different factors that affect water quality.

The "Water Quality Analysis" project has significant practical applications in various industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and public health. By accurately predicting water quality, the model can help industries make informed decisions about water usage, reduce the risk of contamination, and protect public health.
